# Overcomplicated Pong

Pong written entirely in Java with no external dependencies as a challenge for myself. It's not optimized at all and could be easily improved, but worked well as a challenge for myself.

# Features:

- A modular object system which makes it easy to create/remove objects.
- Computer operated paddles which perform smart actions for how little code is involved.
- 9 different playable paddle combinations.
- Framerate independent movement, ensuring you move the same distance no matter your frame rate.
- Proper scaling to any resolution within the Game stage.

# Release

A playable Jar is available under the Releases tab of this GitHub repository.
